    <p>I am going to start talking here. Life has been difficult. I am really getting stir-crazy, just sitting around playing games, sleeping, and applying to jobs. I don't know, I need to make a change. I had a pretty good interview last week, still waiting to hear back. They told me they will get back in about 2 weeks, which to me means they are looking at other candidates. Anyway, hoping to have more of these posts in the future, maybe eventually go daily. I kind of want to try my hand at streaming again, see if anybody has any interest. We'll get there!</p>
